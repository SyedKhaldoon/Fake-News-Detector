# Fake News Detector
News detection and prediction are two important aspects of news analytics. News detection involves identifying and categorizing news articles based on their topic, sentiment, source, and other relevant factors.News prediction involves forecasting future events based on the analysis of past news articles.

In this Project, We have used various natural language processing techniques and Deep learning algorithms to classify Pakistan Political news as Real or Fake and predict the probability of News to be authentic in the near future using keras and tensorrflow libraries in python.

## Problem Statement
To develop a technique through web portal which can detect news as Fake or Real and predict the analytical part.
## Motivation
A survey conducted by the Digital Rights Foundation in 2022 that 73% of Pakistanis had encountered fake news.Misinformation has had a significant impact in Pakistan over the last four to five years, and there is currently no system in place to detect misinformation and predict the analytical part.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.
### Prerequisites
Things you need to install:

1. Python 3.10
 * This setup requires Python 3.10 to be installed on your machine. Python can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Once you've downloaded and installed Python, you'll need to configure PATH variables and set a virtual enviornment on your VS Code. 
2. You will also need to download and install below packages after you install python 
 * keras
 * tensorflow
 * sklearn
 * flask
3. Xampp
 * You also need to install xampp for database. Xampp Can be downloaded from https://www.apachefriends.org/.
## Dataset
Because there was no dataset of Pakistan political news, we manually collected 5k text-based datasets related to Pakistan politics from various platforms, news channels, websites, and social media.We provided a total of 5K news, of which 4K are Real and 1K are fake News.The dataset has 16 columns in total, which are as follows:
    * Column 1: The ID of news
    * Column 2: News Title
    * Column 3: News Text which contains the claims and statement of News
    * Column 4: Published Date of news
    * Column 5:
